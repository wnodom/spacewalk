      Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
      everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every
      human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
      joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
      economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
      every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
      every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
      inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt
      politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and
      sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust
      suspended in a sunbeam.

      The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
      rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
      glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
      fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
      inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable
      inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings,
      how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

      Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have
      some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point
      of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping
      cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint
      that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

      The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
      nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
      migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment
      the Earth is where we make our stand.

      It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
      experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
      human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
      underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
      and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever
      known.
